* Distributions

This folder provide functions on distributions. For each distribution ```dist```, it should provide 
three functions, namely 

- ```ddist```: evalute the density of a sample given parameters
- ```pdist```: evalute the cumulative probability of a sample given parameters
- ```rnorm```: draw a sample given parameters

Since the results of ```ddist``` and ```pdist``` are always scalars, so the results are given by 
returned value. For mutivariate distributions, the results of ```rnorm``` can be an array. To make
all interface identical, we use the first argument as the return value.

* Done
  1. Scalar distributions implemented in rmath library.
  2. Multivariate normal
  3. Wishart
* Todo
  1. Multivariate t Distribution
  2. (Multivariate) Pareto distributions
  3. Dirichlet Distribution
  4. Add likelihood ratio function to each distribution
