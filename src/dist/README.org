* Distributions

This folder provide functions on distributions. For each distribution ```dist```, it should provide 
three functions, namely 

- ```ddist```: evalute the density of a sample given parameters
- ```pdist```: evalute the cumulative probability of a sample given parameters
- ```rnorm```: draw a sample given parameters

Since the results of ```ddist``` and ```pdist``` are always scalars, so the results are given by 
returned value. For mutivariate distributions, the results of ```rnorm``` can be an array. To make
all interface identical, we use the first argument as the return value.

* Done
  1. Scalar distributions implemented in rmath library.
  2. Multivariate normal
  3. Wishart

* Notes
** Notes on truncated normal distribution
   1. "P" functions are based on the the ```mvtnorm``` package in R. The main functions
      are in file ```mvt.hh``` (transformed from ```mvt.f```). And the file ```tmvnorm```
      should include ```mvt.hh```.
   2. "R" functions are reimplementation of the ```TruncatedNormal``` package in R
      with C++. They create identical samples for now, which is a bit slow but good
      for debugging.
   3. ```pmvnorm``` computes the probability measure of a box area defined by ```lower```
      and ```upper```. And to use that, one can optionally provide a ```Mvt``` object.
      This object can be reused arbitrarily *IN A SINGLE THREAD*, so to speed up, when 
      one has to call ```pmvnorm``` multiple times, providing a ```Mvt``` object is
      preferred. For multithreading, one Mvt must be provided for each thread.
      

* Todo
  1. Multivariate t Distribution
  2. (Multivariate) Pareto distributions
  3. Dirichlet Distribution
  4. Add likelihood ratio function to each distribution
  5. Make arguments ```const``` wherever possible
