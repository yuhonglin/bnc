* Distributions

This folder provides functions on distributions. For each univariate distribution /dist/, it should provide 
four functions, namely 

- /ddist/: evalute the density of a sample given parameters
- /pdist/: evalute the cumulative probability of a sample given parameters
- /rdist/: draw a sample given parameters
- /qdist/: compute the quantile of specific probability

For mutivariate distribution (/mvnorm/) quantile functions are not implemented.

* Done
  1. Scalar distributions implemented in rmath library.
  2. Multivariate normal
  3. Wishart

* Notes
** Notes on truncated normal distribution
   1. "P" functions are based on the the /mvtnorm/ package in R. The main functions
      are in file /mvt.hh/ (transformed from /mvt.f/). And the file /tmvnorm/
      should include /mvt.hh/.
   2. "R" functions are reimplementation of the /TruncatedNormal/ package in R
      with C++. They create identical samples for now, which is a bit slow but good
      for debugging.
   3. /pmvnorm/ computes the probability measure of a box area defined by /lower/
      and /upper/. And to use that, one can optionally provide a /Mvt/ object.
      This object can be reused arbitrarily *IN A SINGLE THREAD*, so to speed up, when 
      one has to call /pmvnorm/ multiple times, providing a /Mvt/ object is
      preferred. For multithreading, one Mvt must be provided for each thread.
      
* Todo
  1. Multivariate t Distribution
  2. (Multivariate) Pareto distributions
  3. Dirichlet Distribution
  4. Add likelihood ratio function to each distribution (used in Metropolis-Hasting algorithm)
  5. Make arguments /const/ wherever possible

* Bottle neck of performance
** /brmath/
   From profiling, the /pnorm/ function is the bottle neck for truncated normal sampling. Maybe adding
   /const/ to those functions' arguments can help improve it.
